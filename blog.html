		<p class="quote">Indian journalist Vir Sanghvi once said, “You want your city clean and green, stick to Delhi.You want your city rich and impersonal, go to Bombay.You want them hi-tech and full of draught beer, Bangalore’s your place.But if you want a city with a soul, come to Calcutta.”

The quote is true even in its basic sense. The city has earned the nickname ‘city of joy’ for its soulful embodiment of culture, love, mystery, respect, enthusiasm and definitely some amazing sweet delicacies. Kolkata, as it is now referred to as, is a city that upholds a perfect juxtaposition between the old world and the modern one.</p></br>

<p>Kolkata is one of India’s largest city and with landmarks like the Victoria Memorial, the Maidan and Fort William, Octorlony Monument, the Indian Museum, the Eden Gardens, the elegant Cathedrals and Churches, the Howrah Bridge, pilgrim spots like Kalighat, Dakshineswar and Belur Math as well as Nobel Laureate Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity etc…has been exerting its mesmerizing charm to the discerning international tourists.

To many discerning tourists Kolkata is often ugly and desperate place that to many people sums up the worst of India. Yet, it’s also one of the most fascinating city in India and has scenes of rare beauty. The city was the capital of British India but, unlike Delhi, Kolkata is not an ancient city with a long history. In fact, the city is really a British invention dating only 300 plus years.</p>
